Working within SSL Intercept
============================

This page details how to get many different programs working with SSL intercept. [Another page](UsingGitWithHTTPSInterception.md) details how to configure git.

# 1) Build complete CA file including SSL Intercept certificate

CustomCA.crt must be a PEM encoded file.
If file is not currently PEM encoded (ascii with `-----BEGIN ...`), use openssl
to convert:
```
openssl -in CustomCA.der -inform DER -out CustomCA.crt -outform PEM
```


## Linux:

On linux systems the `.crt` extension matters. The following script may be
of some use on RedHat (and similar) or Debian (and similar) distributions:
```
#!/bin/bash

WGETDEB="wget http://blockpage.doi.gov/images/DOIRootCA.crt -N -P /usr/share/ca-certificates/extra/"
WGETRPM="wget http://blockpage.doi.gov/images/DOIRootCA.crt -N -P /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/"

if [ -f /etc/redhat-release ] ; then
  echo "Installing for Cent/RHEL 32"
  yum -y install ca-certificates
  update-ca-trust force-enable
  $WGETRPM
  update-ca-trust extract
elif [ ! -f /etc/redhat-release ] ; then
  echo "Installing for Debian/Ubuntu"
  $WGETDEB
  echo "extra/DOIRootCA.crt" >> /etc/ca-certificates.conf
  update-ca-certificates
fi
```
Administrators using Chef to manage their infrastructure might also find from the [CIDA Chef Cookbook](https://github.com/USGS-CIDA/chef-cookbook-doi-ssl-filtering) (CentOS 6.x).

### Debian
As root:
```
apt-get install ca-certificates
mkdir -p /usr/local/share/ca-certificates
cp CustomCA.crt /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/.
update-ca-certificates
```

CA file:
`/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt`

### RedHat (and variants CentOS/Scientific Linux)
As root:
```
yum install ca-certificates
update-ca-trust enable
cp CustomCA.crt /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/.
update-ca-trust extract
```

CA file:
`/etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.trust.crt`


## OS X
OS X stores certificates in the keychain, which is not used by most command line
tools.

Start by copying an existing CA certificate bundle.  There are a couple options:
- copy from a linux distro
- copy the openssl bundle from homebrew
  ( /path/to/homebrew/etc/openssl/cert.pem )
- download the Mozilla bundle from cURL
  ( https://curl.haxx.se/ca/cacert.pem )

Then add the custom certificate to the end:
```
# setup CA certificate bundle
CA_FILE=$HOME/cacert.pem
# add a trailing newline character
echo >> $CA_FILE
# add custom certificate
cat CustomCA.crt >> $CA_FILE
```

CA file:
`$HOME/cacert.pem`


# 2) Configure apps to use complete CA file
The examples below reference file as `/path/to/cert.pem`, and should be
updated to reference the system dependent CA file path.  The examples below
also assume `bash` is used as the default shell, and can be updated to modify
other shell environments.

Many applications use the `SSL_CERT_FILE` environment
variable as a source for certificate authorities.
Configure `SSL_CERT_FILE` environment variable in `$HOME/.bash_profile`
```
export SSL_CERT_FILE=/path/to/cert.pem
```

## Anaconda python environments
Configure `ssl_verify` variable
```
conda config --set ssl_verify /path/to/cert.pem
```

## cURL
Configure ```CURL_CA_BUNDLE``` environment variable in ```$HOME/.bash_profile```

```sh
export CURL_CA_BUNDLE=/path/to/cert.pem
```

## Java
Java applications use a system/application keystore for CA certificates in a file called "cacerts", and the DOIRootCA can be imported with the certificate file from the command line, with administrative rights:

e.g. C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_101\jre\lib\security
```sh
keytool -import -file DOIRootCA.crt -alias doiRootCa -keystore cacerts
```

## Node
Node appears to ignore the SSL_CERT_FILE environment variable, although
they are looking into fixing this.
https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/8334

Applications should attempt to configure their ssl library of choice globally
based on the `SSL_CERT_FILE` environment variable at startup, similar to
https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/4175#issuecomment-238211757

## NPM
Configure `cafile` in `$HOME/.npmrc`
```
cafile=/path/to/cert.pem
```
To install packages globally via commands like `sudo npm install --global less`, you may need to add the same line to `/root/.npmrc`.

## Bower
Configure `ca` in `$HOME/.bowerrc`
```
{
"ca": "/path/to/cert.pem"
}
```
or you can use the option `--config.ca=/path/to/cert.pem` when using the bower command to install packages

## Pip
Even when using Anaconda virtual environments, some packages must be installed
using pip.

Configure `PIP_CERT` environment variable in `$HOME/.bash_profile`.
```
export PIP_CERT=/path/to/cert.pem
```

## Python
Python uses the `SSL_CERT_FILE` environment variable (see above).

## Wget
Configure `ca_certificate` in `$HOME/.wgetrc`
```
ca_certificate=/path/to/cert.pem
```
